TODO:

Server:
- Bid function {around line 79} - only check against the global highest bid                          [Done]
- New function HandleBid; should be a goroutine; handle new client (possibly another function as well); is the bid the new highest globally?  [Partially Done, needs case for exception]
- SendResultToAll: redo the function;
- KillAuctioneers: implement when they quit or are dead
- ResultsWhenTimeRunsOut: implement a message that says something like "the winner of the item is..."; more refinement needed
- Message for receiveQueryForResultAndSendToClient()
- Implement addToMessageQueue() every time someone or something needs to broadcast something
- Since we need to call more servers, implement a solution for several servers in the main main() function and un-hardcode server ID in the server main()
- Subscribe to the result stream?
- Handle the case when the highest bidder quits?

Client:
- Remove client name
- receiveFromResult: implement (client line 108)
- Check in user input if it is a bid or result + edit the welcome message
- recvBidStatus() send status message
- Edit welcome message in general
- Delete enterUsername()
- concern about Setup()
- UserInput: implement result and bid

CHANGES:

Server:
- Delete amount from sub struct
- No need to send to all clients (no requirement)
